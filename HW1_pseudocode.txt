Pseudocode for HW1

In the main() function 
Prompt the user for input for the desired year using the getYear() function 
The first function get_year_start(given) gets the starting day of the year user inputs
Calls the printCalendar() function to print the calendar of the year the user inputs  which is the end of main function 
In the get_year_start function, enter the formuala that calculates the starting day of the inputted year 
return the variable that stores it into the variable starting day
In the printCalendar() function
loop through each of the 12 months and print all the months of the given year through printMonthName() function
The printMonthName function uses switch statements 
Set case 0 as January and Case 1 as february and so till case 11 which is December
Set the number of days in each of the month in a int num_days variable  
The printMonth() function prints one month of a calendar and returns the starting date of the next month
Initialize a counter that loops through all the days of the week 
Set printMonthName to num_days 
Print all the days of the week from Sun to Sat 
Make a for loop for checking what day is the starting day 
Add gaps before the starting day 
Make another for loop for looping through the first of the month 
Set int i to starting day and making i less than 7 (7 days of the week)
Print the days of the first week 
Increment for each day 
Print a new line after the loop ends 
Make a new for loop which will also be a nested in a for loop 
Check if the counter(day) is less than or greater than num_days 
Then make another for loop which will be nested and loops through each day of the week after the first week
Then add an if statement to check if the day (counter) is less than num_days
Print the days of the week
Increment each day 
Then do an else statement 
If false, then it's going to enter two new lines 
Print two new lines 
Return i 
Then outside of the second for loop print a new line 
Return 0 to check if the program executed successfully
