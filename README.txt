Homework 1 - Calendar

Summary: 
The objective of the program is to print a Calendar of the year inputted by the user. The user
inputs a year and the program will print out the Calendar with all the months in that year from 
January to December and all the days from Sunday to Monday in each month. The program uses three 
functions get_start_year(), printMonth(), and printMonthName() to make the Calendar. To run the 
program it needs to be complied again using the commands C:\Users\Vivek\Desktop\Term C\CS_2303_Projects\
Homework\Homework 1> to save it to the right folder and then gcc calendar.c to compile it and then .\a.exe 
to execute it. Initially, I had problems getting all the days in the week in the right format anf having all 
dates in on the right day of the week. The problem had to do with minor errors in the logic of the for loops 
and also in the formatting of the gaps between the dates and days of the week.

I have discussed the assignment details and brainstromed ways to approach the program with Jahnavi Prudhivi and Samruddhi Naik. 
We shared ideas of how to think about the logic for each of the functions and Samruddhi Naik has helped to think about the logic 
closely and look for errors.
